# Ray Casting Prototype

This project contains a ray casting prototype generated by manipulating a raw 8 bit RGBA frame buffer. The resulting texture data is subsequently pushed to a WGPU render pipeline and displayed via a Winit window surface.

## Run

`cargo r -r`

## Controls

```
key e = move forward
key d = move backward
key s = rotate left
key f = rotate right
```
